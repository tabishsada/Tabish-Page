Hi! I am a final year CS undergrad at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](http://nitk.ac.in). I like working with/on large scale data, distributed systems and building data products. I'm also interested in data analysis, data visualisations, statistics and machine learning.

I hack in Python and Javascript. For data analysis and visualization, I mostly work in Python and d3.js. I use IPython Notebook for interactively exploring data - it's a little like Mathematica in that it gives you a bunch of discrete cells for code, with output below, that you can tweak and re-run repeatedly. The scientific computing community in Python is pretty great - I use Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, and other libraries along those lines.
